  itemDescription: 'A pork chop, like other meat chops, is a loin cut taken perpendicular
    to the spine of the pig and is usually a rib or part of a vertebra. Pork chops
    are unprocessed and leaner than other cuts. Chops are commonly served as an individual
    portion, and can be accompanied with applesauce, vegetables, and other sides.
    Pork is one of the most commonly consumed meats in the world.
